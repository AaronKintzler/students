I am Matthew Kramer and I am a senior currently pursuing a Computer Science Degree with a minor in Cyber Security. I instantly found a love for programming after my first computer science class in High School and am trying to convert that into a stable occupation. I chose this class due to the description sounding interesting and being outside of my comfort zone. I hope to learn a lot in this class to better gauge what I want to work on when I complete my degree. When I am not working on my computer, I love to rock climb and play guitar.
