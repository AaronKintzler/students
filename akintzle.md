I am Aaron Kintzler and I am a computer science student at the University of TN. I've worked for Amazon over the
summer and contributed to the UT NASA CubeSat Program here on campus. I am passionate about understanding the
tools to use machine learning and developing tools for engineers to analyze data. I also love Italian food.
