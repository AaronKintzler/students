I am Cai John

I am a Bredesen Center doctoral student in Data Science and Engineering. 
I completed my undergraduate degree in Physics from The University of Edinburgh.
Enjoying the mathematical and computational components of my degree I made the decision to transition towards Data Science.
I spent my last year working at The Jackson Laboratory under Gregory Carter researching Alzheimer's Disease as a Biostatistician.
I look forward to this course as one of the common obstacles to analytical projects is a lack of data. Being able to generate 
your own datasets thru scraping and data mining is a skill that opens up a whole world of data for both personal and professional projects.

Outside of work I currently focus on rock climbing although have a history of photography and skateboarding. I enjoy socializing and nature.
