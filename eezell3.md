I am Evan Ezell and I am a data science phd student in the Bredesen Center. 
I have worked on a variety of different projects at Oak Ridge National Laboratory
including developing several tools for the Toxicology and Hazard Assessment Group, 
optimizing spatio-temporal algorithms for the World Spatio-Temporal Analytics and 
Mapping Project, and conducting various data analysis and data visualizations for
high volume geographic datasets for the Geographic Information Science and 
Technology Group. Outside of work, I enjoy hiking, playing chess, watching baseball, 
and spending time with family and friends, usually over good food.
