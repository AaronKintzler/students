I am Emily Herron, a first year Data Science PhD student. As an undergraduate, I majored in Computational Science and worked on research projects dealing with image file and time series data. I am excited about this course because I would like to learn about the tools that exist for scrapping data from the internet and other sources and organizing it in order to discover interesting patterns.
