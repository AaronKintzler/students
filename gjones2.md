I am Gerald Jones. I am a senior in Computer Science. I enjoy gaming, especially fighting games, streaming Horror and Science fiction
movies and TV, and learning. I love to code when the spirit moves me and go through obsessive episodes with it. I love it when
I code and can determine and/or code the underlying algorithm driving some process. Codeing makes me feel like I am able to see the order 
in the chaos. The idea of grabing some mass amount of data and finding the order and patterns there in intrigues me.
