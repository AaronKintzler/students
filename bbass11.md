I am Brett Bass.

I am a first year Data Science and Engineering PhD student. 
I received my BS in Mechanical Engineering and my MS in Renewable Energy Systems from the University of Dayton.
I worked for Emerson Climate Technologies for the last two years doing predictive modeling and diagnostics on reefer shipping containers.
I have worked in the data science field but I am primarily self taught so I am excited to learn in this way and excited to work with Python as my experience has been in R.
