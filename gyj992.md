I am Rojae Johnson and I am a senior here at majoring in computer engineering and minoring in cybersecurity. I recently had an internship focusing on electronics/data forensics and would like to learn so new tools to apply when I go back! I am looking forward to seeing how what I've picked up and what we learn in this class differ.
